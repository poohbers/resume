## Experience
**Poohbers**
Over the past year, I have learned a lot of front-end development. I wanted to take all of that knowledge and build my own site from scratch. I wrote everything including, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. **[You can check out the site](http://poohbers.com)**.

**QVC Interactive Experiences**
For it's most popular shows, QVC wanted to have an interactive experience that fans could use while watching the show. I worked on the design and CSS for *The Lisa Robertson Show* and *You're Home with Jill*, along with another designer and developer.

**Project H**
This was a research team that was tasked with rethinking the QVC web experience. I worked with a creative director, designers, UX, and social team members to look at where QVC is today and where it could be in the future.

**ITKWD Chat**
“In The Kitchen With David” (ITKWD) is one of the most popular shows on QVC. David's team wanted a place where fans could go to chat during the live show. I teamed up with a developer and designer to build this, and I worked on the design and CSS. The chat has expanded to other shows on the network and is available through the QVC iPad app.

**Info Portrayal**
This was a research team that was tasked with rethinking the QVC televised broadcast graphics. I worked with a creative director, designers, and motion graphics animator to conceptualize and design future QVC broadcast interactions and graphics.

**Magic Image Grabber**
I, along with a developer created a tool for the design department to look up product images. Before, the designers had to manually type and edit a complicated URL. Now, they type in a product number and get all of the available images. It is a very successful product that about 50+ people in the company continue to use today.

**Yagglo**
I went to **[Philly Startup Weekend](http://philly.startupweekend.org/)** with an idea, a new web browser for the iPad. I was able to team up with two other guys, and together, we were able to put together a rough prototype and **[win](http://technical.ly/philly/2012/04/23/yagglo-bests-17-other-startups-to-win-startup-weekend/)**.
